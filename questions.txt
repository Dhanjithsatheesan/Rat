 If I told you that your shadow whispers secrets about you, would you believe me?
 Has anyone ever told you that you look like someone trying to be human?
 Do you smell like that on purpose or is it a natural talent?
 Why do your eyes look like they’ve seen something they shouldn’t?
 If I borrowed your toothbrush, would you even notice?
 When you speak, do you hear the same nonsense we do?
 Have you ever considered that maybe you’re the reason pets avoid certain rooms?
 Do you think mirrors are scared of your reflection?
 Are you always this awkward or is today special?
 Has anyone ever dug a hole to avoid talking to you?
 If your personality was a soup, would it be cold and slightly sour?
 Why does it feel like you blink just a little too slowly?
 Would you survive a horror movie, or would the ghost just leave out of pity?
 Do you talk to your plants, or do they talk to you first?
 If you disappeared, would anyone suspect foul play or just assume you wandered off?
 Have you always looked like you’re hiding a dark secret?
 If your brain had a loading screen, what would it say?
 Do your thoughts echo or do they just quietly cry?
 Were you raised by humans or just heavily influenced by reality TV?
 When was the last time someone made eye contact with you without flinching?
